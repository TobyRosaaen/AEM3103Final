  ## Summary of Findings
  <Show the variations studied in a table>

  Summarized what was accomplished in this study.  Describe 2-4 observations from simulating the flight path.
  Reference the figures below as needed.

  *If the analysis falls short of the goal, this is your chance to explain what was done or what were the barriers.*
 
  # Code Listing
  A list of each function/script and a single-line description of what it does.  The name of the function/script should link to the file in the repository on GitHub.

  # Figures

  ## Fig. 1: Single Parameter Variation
![HeightVsRange](https://github.com/TobyRosaaen/AEM3103Final/assets/167818556/5acdf430-79f4-4e8d-a9ce-b437a52a7778)

  The top graph shows the height vs range of the paper plane at a lower, nominal, and higher velocity while keeping the flight path angle constant. The bottom graph shows the height vs range of the paper plane at a lower, nominal, and higher flight path angle while keeping the velocity constant.
